Exploring the multiple meanings of “spectacle,” Isenstein’s work investigates the legacy of church reliquaries, anatomy exhibitions, and lens technology to answer the question, “what makes a body an object?” Through her performance-sculptures and video works, Isenstein “confuses subjects and objects by turning bodies into objects and objects into bodies.”</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: Drawing on avant-garde cinema and found photographs, Saunders’s multimedia works explore the mobility and affective power of images. This publication encompasses eight years of work by Cambridge, MA- and Berlin-based artist Matt Saunders (born 1975), who engages painting as a time-based medium through cameraless photography, animation, and innovative painting and printmaking processes. Best known for his haunting portraits and landscapes (using imagery culled from avant-garde cinema and found photographs) and moving-image works, Saunders uses analog materials to explore the affective power of images.</p>
                        <p>Focusing on his experimentation with color processes, the stunning reproductions in this volume range from his first color film, <i>Century Rolls</i> (2012), to his more recent large-scale video installations. Moving image folds together with painting, photography, and print, enlivening our relationship to images and their capacity for uncanny returns, echoes, and ghosts.</p>

My Barbarian has used performance to theatricalize social issues, adapting narratives from modern plays, historical texts, and mass media; this volume accompanies a major retrospective celebrating the group’s twentieth anniversary. An overview essay relates their work’s formal qualities to several historical moments over this span: the club era following September 11, 2001; postcolonial theater after the 2008 financial collapse; and political theater responding to the pressing issues of today. Other contributions read the collective’s output through a lens of queer and other critical theory, and contextualize it within the twenty-first-century experimental performance scene. A richly illustrated visual chronology features texts on each of My Barbarian’s past works written by the artists. Performances and video works are re-created using stills alongside photos, drawings, scripts, and personal materials drawn from the artists’ archives, many never previously published.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: In 2018, Glenstone Museum opened the Pavilions, part of an expansion that includes additional exhibition space and over 130 additional acres of grounds. Designed by Thomas Phifer, the Pavilions features 11 distinct gallery spaces. <i>Glenstone: The Pavilions</i> features photographs by acclaimed architecture photographer Iwan Baan as well as contributions from architectural historian and critic Paul Goldberger; architect, preservationist, and historian Michelangelo Sabatino; and architect and curator Susana Ventura.</p>
                        <p>This publication documents the evolution of the design and construction of the Pavilions, starting with the selection of architecture firm Thomas Phifer and Partners in 2010 and culminating in a portfolio of images of the finished project by renowned architecture photographer Iwan Baan. Highlighting the collaborative process behind the Pavilions, this book features a transcript of a panel discussion held at Glenstone in 2018 in which Glenstone’s Founders, Mitchell P. and Emily Wei Rales, were in conversation with Phifer and landscape architect Adam Greenspan of Peter Walker and Partners. Noted architectural historian and critic Paul Goldberger moderated the discussion, having served as an adviser during the architectural selection process and throughout every phase of the design, and has also contributed an essay to this volume. Two additional texts offer insightful commentary as well—architect, preservationist, and historian Michelangelo Sabatino elaborates on the typology of the Pavilions and situates Glenstone within the history of museum architecture, and architect and curator Susana Ventura meditates on the visitor’s heightened aesthetic experience of moving through the building.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: Our most intimate spaces are increasingly sites of intersubjective relations. The widespread presence of technological networks especially has made visible the ways that agency and subjectivity are often distributed, engendering theories of hybrid subjects who might integrate the human with other biological or technological agents. These incursions into traditional notions of subjectivity not only destabilize our sense of autonomy but also explode the human sensorium, reminding us that it is only one of many viable systems for sensing, perceiving, and communicating. This collection of essays, conversations, and artworks explores how technology now mediates our encounters and, in doing so, forms alternate, networked subjectivities. It asks how intersubjective intimacy might be theorized epistemologically, aesthetically, philosophically, and politically, and considers how such relative intimacy might connect physical matter and cybernetic systems or forge new subjectivities between constellations of actors. Bringing together academic, curatorial, and artistic perspectives, <i>Relative Intimacies</i> initiates points of contact between artificial, biological, and emotional intelligence.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: This posthumously published work serves as the fourth and final volume in Anne Truitt’s remarkable series of journals. In the spring of 1974, the artist Anne Truitt (1921–2004) committed herself to keeping a journal for a year. She would continue the practice, sometimes intermittently, over the next six years, writing in spiral-bound notebooks and setting no guidelines other than to “let the artist speak.” These writings were published as <i>Daybook: The Journal of an Artist</i> (1982). Two other journal volumes followed: <i>Turn</i> (1986) and <i>Prospect</i> (1996). This book, the final volume, comprises journals the artist kept from the winter of 2001 to the spring of 2002, two years before her death.</p>
                        <p>In <i>Yield</i>, Truitt’s unflinching honesty is on display as she contemplates her place in the world and comes to terms with the intellectual, practical, emotional, and spiritual issues that an artist faces when reconciling her art with her life, even as that life approaches its end. Truitt illuminates a life and career in which the demands, responsibilities, and rewards of family, friends, motherhood, and grandmotherhood are ultimately accepted, together with those of a working artist.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: An exploration of the art and writing of Louise Bourgeois through the lens of her relationship with Freudian psychoanalysis. From 1952 to 1985, Louise Bourgeois (1911–2010) underwent extensive Freudian analysis that probed her family history, marriage, motherhood, and artistic ambition—and generated inspiration for her artwork. Examining the impact of psychoanalysis on Bourgeois’s work, this volume offers insight into her creative process. Philip Larratt-Smith, Bourgeois’s literary archivist, provides an overview of the artist’s life and work and the ways in which the psychoanalytic process informed her artistic practice. An essay by Juliet Mitchell offers a cutting-edge feminist psychoanalyst’s viewpoint on the artist’s long and complex relationship with therapy. In addition, a short text written by Bourgeois (first published in 1991) addresses Freud’s own relationship to art and artists. Featuring excerpts from Bourgeois’s copious diaries, rarely seen notebook pages, and archival family photographs, <i>Louise Bourgeois, Freud’s Daughter</i> opens exciting new avenues for understanding an innovative, influential, and groundbreaking artist whose wide-ranging work includes not only renowned large-scale sculptures but also a plethora of paintings and prints.</p>

Rosenstein (1913–2004) was a prolific artist whose varied output was informed by her experience as a Polish Jew during the Holocaust.</p>

                        <p>Released on the occasion of the eponymous exhibition at Hauser & Wirth in New York, and edited and with a text by exhibition curator Alison M. Gingeras, this book serves as an introduction to Rosenstein and her story. Alongside an extensive plates section, poems by Rosenstein are included in the book, as well as a special insert reproducing a fairy tale authored and illustrated by the artist. Art historian Dorota Jarecka has also contributed an essay, and the book includes Rosenstein’s own narrative testimony of the war in Poland.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;"> Sales copy: Emily Dickinson’s iconic poem, “Forever is Composed of Nows,” presents the idea that every small moment is happening “now” and collectively adds up to “forever,” or a lifetime. What seems so intangible and distant is actually being created out of the experiences we have in the moment.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, regardless of space or time or context, the artists in the exhibition explore recurring moments—centered around home, family, relationships, work, nature, technology, play, adventure, joy, and trauma. These are the “nows” that appear, throughout our lives, in unexpected ways, if we but stop to notice. Like beads on a string, they make up our “forevers.”</p>
                        <p>The artists draw on a range of experiences, methods, and styles to present moments in which hope and optimism mingle with death and decay, and joy and humanism flirt with escape and disaster. It is a fragile forever now. But in their brave and compassionate responses to our contemporary world, their work offers hope and promise for the future.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;"> Sales copy: New York-based painter Joan Snyder (b. 1940) has been making expressive paintings full of personal candor for over 50 years. Snyder’s paintings integrate the modernist grid with raw figuration and nature. Her distinctive mark-making reveals itself in a brightly chromatic palette of pinks, reds, greens, violets; she builds up her paintings using thick mediums and collage materials including fabric, herbs and dried flowers. For <i>The Summer Becomes a Room</i>, her 2020 exhibition at Canada, the artist-run gallery in New York, Snyder made a series of large-scale diptych and triptych paintings, which variously reference the landscape, as well as poetry and music. This book was published alongside the show and features an introduction by Wallace Whitney, essays by Sean Scully and Helen Molesworth; it features the paintings from the show as well as select works from Snyder’s 2016 series titled ‘Love, Mom.’</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: In her large-scale oil paintings, New York-based artist Jordan Casteel (born 1989) takes up questions of Black subjectivity and representation by examining the gestures, spaces and forms of nonverbal communication that underpin portraiture. “There is a certain amount of mindfulness that it requires . . . to be present with someone in a moment.” she explains. “I’ve always had an inclination towards seeing people who might be easily be unseen.”</p>
                        <p>Published for Casteel’s first solo museum exhibition in New York, this volume brings together 40 large-scale paintings from throughout her career, including works from the celebrated series <i>Visible Man</i> (2013–14) and <i>Nights in Harlem</i> (2017), along with recent cropped “subway paintings” and portraits of her students at Rutgers University-Newark. Whether depicting former classmates from Yale, nude and in serene repose; street vendors near her home in Harlem; anonymous New Yorkers huddled on the subway; or her own students, posed largely in domestic interiors among their personal belongings, she explores how both public and private spheres can serve as frames for an inner life.</p>
                        <p>This generously illustrated, oversized publication honors the larger-than-life scale of the artist’s work. It is the first comprehensive monographic publication on Casteel’s work and includes texts by Dawoud Bey, Amanda Hunt and Lauren Haynes, and conversations conducted with the artist by Massimiliano Gioni and Thelma Golden.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: Published to accompany the first US retrospective exhibition of Donald Judd’s sculpture in more than thirty years, <i>Judd</i> explores the work of a landmark artist who, over the course of his career, developed a material and formal vocabulary that transformed the field of modern sculpture.  Donald Judd was among a generation of artists in the 1960s who sought to entirely do away with illusion, narrative, and metaphorical content. <i>Judd</i> surveys the evolution of his work, beginning with his paintings, reliefs, and handmade objects from the early 1960s; through the years in which he built an iconic vocabulary of works in three dimensions, including hollow boxes, stacks, and progressions made with metals and plastics by commercial fabricators; and continuing through his extensive engagement with color during the last decade of his life. This richly illustrated catalogue takes a close look at Judd’s achievements, and using newly available archival materials at the Judd Foundation and elsewhere, expands scholarly perspectives on his work. Essays by curators and scholars address subjects such as his early beginnings in painting, the fabrication of his sculptures, his site-specific pieces, and his work in design and architecture.

                        <p>Press release excerpts:</p>
                        <p>Looking at these drawings, it appears that they are all based on photos of pink line drawings in a bound notebook.</p>
                        <p>Where were you when you made them?</p>
                        <p><i>I had just moved into a new studio and wasn’t ready to unpack.</i></p>
                        <p>So these are drawings on photographs of drawings on photographs of sculpture.</p>
                        <p><i>In the nineteenth century a series of major excavations of Greek and Roman statues were documented by French and British photographers. The relationship of the camera to sculpture goes back to its invention.</i></p>
                        <p>[. . .] References to classical sculpture turn up in your work with some regularity. There was that model of the <i>Winged Victory of Samothrace</i>, flocked in blue à la Yves Klein, in a piece in your last show at the gallery. And then there are your <i>Studs</i> sculptures—each a standard wooden stud mounted upright on a base—whose relationship to classical sculpture, though not immediately obvious, was made explicit in a recent exhibition at Tokyo’s Rat Hole Gallery by your pairing them with photographs of often desecrated Greek statues. As writer and museum director Johanna Burton has noted, the studs are all warped, “[w]hich studs are prone to do if faultily treated; this staple of Western construction asks wood to behave against its very nature, which is to be neither rigid nor straight.”</p>
                        <p>There’s also the fact that by strange coincidence, you’re presenting these drawings at a time when our current administration has proposed making all US federal buildings conform to the Neoclassical mold. In his essay for this show’s catalog, artist Paul Chan writes that your art is non-salvific—i.e. it resists “the self-certainty and self-regard that announces authority’s appearance.”</p>
                        <p>[. . .] Your sculptures, even when as abstract as <i>The Studs</i>, are often not only semi-figurative, but anthropomorphic—they loom, they huddle, they stumble, they proffer and enfold. Sometimes they even wear shoes. And your 2007 photographic series <i>Voyage of the Beagle</i> is a boisterous grouping of found figurative images ranging from a prehistoric menhir to a stuffed polar bear to a kitten printed on a plastic toilet-seat cover.</p>
                        <p>It's quite a crowded scene in these works. Why the layering of figures? Are they in conversation?</p>
                        <p><i>Italo Calvino wrote: “A classic is something that persists as a background noise even when the most incompatible momentary concerns are in control of the situation.”</i></p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: This book extends into book form Nick Mauss’s highly acclaimed 2018 exhibition <i>Transmissions</i> at the Whitney Museum of American Art, which was heralded by the New York Times as “an installation, a collage of several art forms, a revisionist investigation of New York modernism and sexual expression, and an essay in queer theory. . . . The juxtapositions show that <i>Transmissions</i> is a work of creative imagination as much as revelation.” The richly illustrated volume includes never-before published reproductions of documents and artworks by Eugene Berman, Ilse Bing, Paul Cadmus, Maya Deren, Walker Evans, Peter Hujar, George Platt Lynes, Elie Nadelman, Isamu Noguchi, PaJaMa, Dorothea Tanning, Pavel Tchelitchew, Carl Van Vechten, and many more. Photographs by Paula Court and Ken Okiishi conjure the dance that was produced live daily for the exhibition’s duration, and an extensive conversation among the dancers brings rare insight into the process of making performance-based work. The essays consider subjects of ballet and the body, Mauss’s work as artist and exhibition maker, performance and historiography, and dance in museum spaces.

                        <p>Based on Interference Archive’s online exhibition of the same name, <i>Walkout: A Brief History of Student Organizing</i> focuses on how student organizing emerged in the post-World War II era as the avenue through which postwar generations could participate in public dialogue and critique existing systems. Organized by decade, materials in this publication focus on student organizing in the United States but make reference to the broader global context of student protests in France, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, and Canada.

                        <p>The artists featured in <i>Black Refractions</i>, including Kerry James Marshall, Faith Ringgold, Nari Ward, Norman Lewis, Wangechi Mutu, and Lorna Simpson, are drawn from the renowned collection of the Studio Museum in Harlem. Through exhibitions, public programs, artist residencies, and bold acquisitions, this pioneering institution has served as a nexus for artists of African descent locally, nationally, and internationally since its founding in 1968. Rather than aim to construct a single history of “black art,”<i>Black Refractions</i> emphasizes a plurality of narratives and approaches, traced through 125 works in all media from the 1930s to the present.</p>
                        <p>An essay by Connie Choi and entries by Eliza A. Butler, Akili Tommasino, Taylor Aldridge, Larry Ossei Mensah, Daniela Fifi, and other luminaries contextualize the works and provide detailed commentary. A dialogue between Thelma Golden, Connie Choi, and Kellie Jones draws out themes and challenges in collecting and exhibiting modern and contemporary art by artists of African descent. More than a document of a particular institution’s trailblazing path, or catalytic role in the development of American appreciation for art of the African diaspora, this volume is a compendium of a vital art tradition.

                        <p>This sumptuous catalogue by Christine Y. Kim and Rujeko Hockley, accompanies a major mid-career survey of Mehretu’s work that opens at the Whitney Museum in June 2019. Designed to allow close viewing of Mehretu’s vast canvases, it features lush reproductions of her paintings in their entirety, as well as numerous full-page details. Accompanying rich images of work from throughout her career are numerous essays by leading curators, scholars, and writers. Long overdue, this magnificent volume pays tribute to an artist whose work and process intermingle in a unique and important examination of painting, history, geopolitics, and displacement.</p>

                        <p>The book is dedicated to the pioneering Nigerian curator Okwui Enwezor, who died before he could complete his contribution, but whose global engagement animates many of its other essays.

Published in conjunction with an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art that will feature a combination of videos, photographs, sculptural elements, ephemera and live actions, <i>member: Pope.L, 1978–2001</i> presents a detailed study of 13 early works that helped define Pope.L’s career. Essays by curators, artists, filmmakers and art historians, plus an interview and artistic interventions by the artist, establish key details for each work and articulate how the artist continues to think about the legacy of these ephemeral projects unfolding in time.</p>
                        <p>Among the works included are performances rooted in experimental theater, such as <i>Egg Eating Contest</i> (1990), <i>Aunt Jenny Chronicles</i> (1991) and <i>Eracism</i> (2000), as well as street interventions such as <i>Thunderbird Immolation a.k.a. Meditation Square Piece</i> (1978), <i>ATM Piece</i> (1997) and <i>The Great White Way: 22 miles, 9 years, 1 street</i> (2001–09), among others. Together these works highlight the role of that performance has played within a seditious, emphatically interdisciplinary career that has established Pope.L as an influential force in contemporary art.

The artwork was inaugurated in July 2016 after 17 years of planning. Irwin’s building-cum-artwork is a career-defining summation of his pioneering art and fulfills a longstanding intention of Chinati founder Donald Judd to include a work by Irwin alongside the renowned collection of permanent installations in Marfa, Texas.</p>

                        <p><i>Robert Irwin: untitled (dawn to dusk)</i> presents and contextualizes Irwin’s artwork through a photographic record of the installation over the course of one year, in addition to critical essays, drawings, plans and illustrations. The publication provides a comprehensive history of the project, describing Irwin’s friendship with Judd and Judd’s support of his work, Chinati’s invitation to the artist in 1999 and the evolution of Irwin’s concept as he visited the site and developed the design for the project.</p>

                        <p>Photography by Alex Marks documents the Irwin project and the effect that the changing seasons and times of day have on the experience of the work.

Pérez Collection</i> are united by an interest in art concerned with social change, art that looks at the conflicts and contradictions of contemporary society, art that critically analyzes and reframes historical events in the present. As both a supplement and response, this publication brings a variety of voices together to shed light upon the complexities of the works in the exhibition, as well as to provide insight into the critical discourses that inform and problematize their institutionalization. This reader is structured around six themes that thread together and establish cross-cutting interpretations of the works in the exhibition: “Entangled Histories,” “Extraction and Flows,” “Artivism: Art in the Social Sphere,” “State Terror,” “Spatial Politics,” and “Emancipatory Calls.” The texts and conversations herein attend to, reflect upon, and call our awareness to issues of trauma and the social body, repression, protest, the forced displacement of peoples, and the extractivist logic that preys upon territory, as well as the veiled, but nonetheless felt, injustices of social control. Each chapter joins new writing with previously published material, thereby offering readers a sense of the divergent, and at times contested, ways in which the exhibition and its works might be understood. The plates in this volume have been interspersed throughout the book, woven in and out of the texts according to the order in which they appear in the exhibition. In some cases the texts have been selected in direct correlation to the works, while in many others they were chosen as lenses through which to read the conditions and contexts of the works in question more broadly. Newly commissioned essays by Denise Ferreira da Silva, Coco Fusco, Suhail Malik, Laura Raicovich, Tobias Ostrander, and Antwaun Sargent.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: One of the most emulated and significant figures in modern art, Andy Warhol (1928–1987) rose to fame in the 1960s with his iconic Pop pieces. Warhol expanded the boundaries by which art is defined and created groundbreaking work in a diverse array of media that includes paintings, sculptures, prints, photographs, films, and installations.</p>
                        <p>This ambitious book is the first to examine Warhol’s work in its entirety. It builds on a wealth of new research and materials that have come to light in recent decades and offers a rare and much-needed comprehensive look at the full scope of Warhol’s production—from his commercial illustrations of the 1950s through his monumental paintings of the 1980s. Donna De Salvo explores how Warhol’s work engages with notions of public and private, the redefinition of media, and the role of abstraction, while a series of incisive and eye-opening essays by eminent scholars and contemporary artists touch on a broad range of topics, such as Warhol’s response to the AIDS epidemic, his international influence, and how his work relates to constructs of self-image seen in social media today.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: Bruce Nauman is widely acknowledged as a central figure in contemporary art, and the stringent questioning of values—both aesthetic and moral—that has long sustained his project remains urgent today. For more than fifty years, Nauman has explored how mutable experiences of time, space, sound, movement, and language provide an insecure foundation for our understanding of our place in the world. This richly illustrated catalogue, which includes rare and previously unpublished images, offers a comprehensive view of the artist’s work in all media—including drawings; early fiberglass sculptures; sound environments; architecturally scaled, participatory constructions; rhythmically blinking neons; and a recent 3-D video that harks back to one of Nauman’s earliest performances. A wide range of authors—artists, curators, and historians of art, architecture, and film—focus on topics that have been largely neglected, such as the architectural structures that posit real or imaginary spaces as models for ethical inquiry and mechanisms of control. Curator Kathy Halbreich’s introductory essay explores Nauman’s many acts of disappearance, withdrawal, and deflection as revelatory of his central formal and intellectual concerns. Eighteen further contributions tease out the various themes that run through this protean and elusive artist’s work.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: Günther Förg (1952–2013) was a German painter, sculptor, and photographer with an irreverent approach to abstraction. Förg’s project tackled the latent instability between image and reality. His painterly surfaces may appear exquisitely sensitive, his installations elegantly precise, but these are mastered and executed with a cold detachment. His deft manipulations of the languages of abstraction obscured a darker message. This publication, the most comprehensive to date, offers an important new understanding of this extraordinary and complex artist. Three years in the making, it reinterprets Förg’s oeuvre to reveal an artistic project that raises important questions about the traditional role of an object as a conveyor of fixed meaning. The book’s subtitle—“A Fragile Beauty”—is an indication of how Förg successfully manipulated what is behind and beyond an object’s appearance.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: Throughout his six-decade career, Tony Conrad (1940–2016) forged a unique path through numerous artistic movements and a vast range of cultural forms—from Fluxus to rock music, from structural film to public access television. Published on the occasion of the first large-scale museum survey devoted to works Conrad presented in museum and gallery settings, this richly illustrated catalogue offers an in-depth introduction to Conrad's life and career.</p>

                        <p>Including new texts and Conrad’s own writings about selected works dating from 1966 to 2016, <i>Introducing Tony Conrad</i> surveys the artist's work in painting, sculpture, film, video, performance and installation. It includes the artist’s early structural films; projects in which he treated film as a sculptural and performative material; his series of Invented Acoustical Tools, presented as sculptures themselves; his ambitious films about power relations, set in the military and in prison; and his final sculptures and installations, which evoke and critique what he perceived as an emerging culture of surveillance, control and containment. The list of contributors testifies to Conrad’s wide and lasting influence; this volume includes texts by Constance DeJong, Diedrich Diederichsen, Anthony Elms, Branden W. Joseph, Tony Oursler and Christopher Williams, among many others.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: The New Museum will present the first American survey exhibition of the work of British artist, film director, and writer John Akomfrah (b. 1957, Accra, Ghana). Since the early 1980s, Akomfrah’s moving image works have offered some of the most rigorous and expansive reflections on the culture of the black diaspora, both in the UK and around the world. Akomfrah’s work initially came to prominence in the early 1980s as part of Black Audio Film Collective, a group of seven artists founded in 1982 in response to the 1981 Brixton riots. The collective produced a number of films notable for their mix of archival and found footage, interviews and realist depictions of contemporary England, and layered sound collages. In works like <i>Handsworth Songs</i> (1986), Akomfrah and Black Audio outlined the political and economic forces leading to social unrest throughout England. Akomfrah and Black Audio’s works were remarkable for their trenchant political inquiries and consistently experimental approach. They were also pioneering in their injection of narratives of black British history and culture into popular media through documentaries made for British television.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the 1990s, Akomfrah’s subject matter expanded beyond the social fractures of contemporary British society to focus on a wider historical context, from the persistent legacy of colonialism to the roots of the contemporary in classical literature. Moving into the early 2000s, Akomfrah also produced a series of atmospheric works addressing personal and historical memory. In the past several years, his multichannel video works have evolved into ambitious, large-scale installations shown in museums around the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although Akomfrah’s work has had a direct and profound influence on subsequent generations of British artists working across media, the importance of his work has yet to be fully felt in America. The centerpiece of the exhibition at the New Museum will be Akomfrah’s celebrated three-screen video installation <i>Vertigo Sea</i> (2015). The work, which first premiered at the 2015 Venice Biennale and will have its first New York presentation at the New Museum, focuses on the ocean as an environmental, cultural, and historical force, connecting literature and poetry, the history of slavery, and contemporary issues of migration and climate change. The exhibition will also include <i>The Unfinished Conversation</i> (2012), Akomfrah’s complex reflection on the life and ideas of cultural theorist Stuart Hall; <i>Expeditions – Signs of Empire</i> (1983), the first work produced by Black Audio Film Collective; and a new version of Akomfrah’s <i>Transfigured Night</i> (2013/2018), a two-channel work looking at the relationship between the US and post-colonial African history.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">In the early 1960s, an assembly of choreographers, visual artists, composers, and filmmakers made use of a church in New York’s Greenwich Village to present performances that redefined the kinds of movement that could be understood as dance—performances that <i>Village Voice</i> critic Jill Johnston would declare the most exciting in a generation. The group was Judson Dance Theater, its name borrowed from Judson Memorial Church, the socially engaged Protestant congregation that hosted the dancers’ open workshops. The Judson artists emphasized new compositional methods meant to strip dance of its theatrical conventions and foregrounded “ordinary” movements—gestures more likely to be seen on the street or at home. Although Judson Dance Theater would last only a few years, the artists affiliated with it, including Trisha Brown, Lucinda Childs, Philip Corner, Bill Dixon, Judith Dunn, Ruth Emerson, David Gordon, Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Fred Herko, Robert Morris, Steve Paxton, Rudy Perez, Yvonne Rainer, Robert Rauschenberg, Carolee Schneemann, and Elaine Summers, would challenge choreographic conventions and profoundly shape art making across various fields for decades to come.</p>
                        <p><i>Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done</i> includes newly commissioned essays that highlight the history of Judson Dance Theater and its legacy in our own time. Published in conjunction with an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, this lushly illustrated volume charts the development of Judson through photographs, film stills, choreographic scores, architectural drawings, and other archival materials, as it celebrates the group’s multidisciplinary and collaborative ethos and its reverberant achievements.

From her early wooden Personages to her large hanging sculptures, from suites of drawings and prints to textile works and her immersive Cells, <i>To Unravel a Torment</i> surveys Bourgeois’s career through selected examples from her enormous body of work. Bourgeois was also a prolific writer, matching her sculptural language with reams of psychoanalytic musings on repression, symbolism, and material. <i>To Unravel a Torment</i> also brings together never-before-published diary entries by the artist, annotated by Bourgeois scholar Philip Larratt-Smith, a contribution by art historian Briony Fer, and extensive installation photography.

This is the most thorough survey of the provocative artist, sculptor, and photographer, Sarah Lucas, one of the most important living British artists. Sarah Lucas, having emerged in the UK in the late 1980s alongside artists including Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst, gained notoriety for her bawdy and irreverent sculptures. Often using found objects, Lucas provokes viewers with works that challenge our notions of gender, sexuality, and identity. Featuring eight essays and an interview with the artist, this volume reveals the breadth and complexity of Lucas's work in sculpture, photography, and installation over the past three decades.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: In its continued emphasis on an art of ideas—inherited from the legacies of conceptual and post-conceptual art—contemporary art often enlists objects to perform as evidence within constellations of research and inquiry. Whether they are borrowed from everyday life or sculpted into new forms, art objects are tasked with conjuring the descriptions that accompany them. What challenges does such mediation pose to the inherent muteness of objects? How do artists choose to speak on behalf of reticent artifacts and the otherwise inert by-products of material culture and the natural world? In what ways do museums and other institutions participate in these arrangements?</p>
                        <p><i>Stories of Almost Everyone</i> is organized around the premise that contemporary art objects possess narrative histories and inner lives that the conventions of display can only, at best, approximate. This exhibition and publication address the means by which a broad range of contemporary artworks and artifacts traffic in meaning and mythology in equal measure. These varied approaches are as emboldened by a faith in objects to communicate their value as they are skeptical of the conditions of museological mediation and art’s promise to convey meaning.</p>

                        <p>From aerial landscapes to the Alaskan wilderness, American cities to natural history museums, there are few subjects that Zoe Leonard has not tackled in her 30-year career. Working primarily in photography and sculpture, Leonard consistently confronts the realities of change, love, and loss. This book brings audiences up to date on Leonard's impressive body of work and accompanies a long-awaited retrospective exhibition. It features images and examinations from every one of Leonard’s major series, including her early aerial and museum photographs, her landmark works⁠—<i>Strange Fruit</i> and <i>Analogue⁠</i>—and her most recent works, “In the Wake.” Essays in the book range from the critical to the personal, including explorations of sexual politics, immigration, and family. Breathtaking in scope and bringing together every facet of Leonard's oeuvre, this volume celebrates Leonard's unflinching eye and her intimate art.

                        <p>So begins Stan Brakhage’s classic <i>Metaphors on Vision</i>. First published in 1963 as a special issue of Film Culture, it stands as the major theoretical statement by one of avant-garde cinema’s most influential figures, a treatise on mythopoeia and the nature of visual experience written in a style as idiosyncratic as his art. By turns lyrical, technical, and philosophical, this is a collection to be shelved alongside the commentaries of Robert Bresson and Maya Deren, Sergei Eisenstein and Nagisa Oshima. Yet despite its historical importance and undeniable influence, the complete <i>Metaphors</i> has remained out of print in the US for over forty years.</p>
                        <p>Now, Anthology Film Archives and Light Industry are proud to present the republication of Metaphors on Vision in a new, definitive edition, featuring a full facsimile of the publication’s original George Maciunas design as well as a corrected version of the text, overseen by P. Adams Sitney. These materials are complemented by Sitney’s introduction to the 1998 French translation of Metaphors on Vision, copious annotations, and an apparatus that meticulously tracks variations in the text across its many iterations.

The New Museum has been committed to urgent ideas since its inception, devoting many exhibitions and programs throughout its history to issues of representation with regard to gender and sexuality, among them “Extended Sensibilities” (1982), “Difference” (1984–85), “HOMO VIDEO” (1986–87), and “Bad Girls” (1994). Following in this tradition, <i>Trigger</i> extends these conversations around identity, while considering how even a fluid conception of gender is marked by ongoing negotiations of power and cannot be understood outside its complex intersections with race, class, sexuality, and disability.</p>
                        <p>Many of the artists in the exhibition embrace explicit pleasure and visual lushness as political strategies. Some deliberately reject or complicate overt representation, turning to poetic language, docufiction, and abstraction to affirm ambiguities and reflect shifting modes of embodiment. Representing no single point of view, and in some cases presenting productively contradictory positions, <i>Trigger</i> assembles artists for their singular efforts in considering gender’s capacity to represent a more general refusal of stable categorization—a refusal at the heart of today’s most compelling artistic practices.</p>
                        <p>Edited by Johanna Burton and Natalie Bell, the catalogue includes essays by Rizvana Bradley, Johanna Burton, and Jeannine Tang, as well as a conversation between Julia Bryan-Wilson and Mel Y. Chen. Three edited roundtable conversations with the exhibition’s advisory group (Lia Gangitano, Ariel Goldberg, Jack Halberstam, Fred Moten, and Eric A. Stanley) as well as monographic entries on the artists in the show provide further insight into the broader questions, ideas, and cultural shifts informing the exhibition and its artists. In addition to over two hundred pages of color reproductions, the catalogue’s institutional archival portfolio, organized by Kate Wiener, traces past Museum exhibitions that have centered on intersections of gender, sexuality, and representation, and the artists’ genealogies section, organized by Sara O’Keeffe, reveals artists’ own formative affinities and artistic filiations within art and culture.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Arcobaleno is a monolinear display sans. Taking as its point of departure Archizoom Associati’s “Grande A” of <i>Letti di sogno</i> (Dream Beds, 1967) and the imagined <i>Ponte Arcobaleno</i> (Rainbow Bridge, 1968), Arcobaleno’s optically symmetrical curves and playful, quirky details seek to capture the group’s at once critical and joyful formal play.</p>

                        <p>FRAC Centre-Val de Loire:<br>
                            “In 1967, using <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, Archizoom imagined the <i>Letti di sogno</i>, and thereby introduced the use of design in a critical way in the civilization of mass consumption. If the form of the bedrooms tends towards a symbolic and sacred simplification, the decoration of these “dream beds” is made voluntarily over the top and kitsch, through the use of imitation marble made from laminated plastic, the superposition of pop symbols and signs, as well as leopard skins and stuffed animals. In their anti-design approach, these micro-architectures denounce the ever increasing proliferation of objects. They are emblematic of an 'aggressive, closed objectuality of opposition, which imposes itself on the surrounding environment by the power of its language' (Andrea Branzi). Here, Archizoom is interested in the image as a whole and, through the image, in the possibility of expressing a judgment on the civilization of the image.”

With the anniversary as an entry point and frame of reference, <i>Walkout: A Brief History of Student Organizing</i> uses archival material from the Interference Archive collection—posters, buttons, pamphlets, flyers, zines, and more—to examine the broader scope of student movements that both led up to and followed in the wake of May 1970.</p>  
                        <p>From its roots in the changes wrought by World War II  through the civil rights  and anti-war movements  of the 1960s, <i>Walkout</i> traces major themes that led American students to strike in 1970 and that have propelled them since, with reference to international movements that influenced tactics and issues for agitation. Of significant note is the way that the graphic production of these movements helps us trace the impact of movements across generations: <i>Walkout</i> showcases material from student art collectives communicating their demands through visual material, including the Atelier Populaire (Paris, 1968), Poster Factory (Wisconsin, 1970), WIMP Collective (New York, 1970), Sublevarte Colectivo (Mexico, 1999), and École de la Montagne Rouge (Montreal, 2012).

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">“Some Type Foundries Want to Restrict Usage of Their Fonts on Ethical Grounds. Will It Work?”</p>
                        <p>Since opening shop in 2009, Zurich-based independent foundry Grilli Type has quietly built a reputation for expertly drawn contemporary designs. Its sharp serif GT Sectra (2013) has become a popular choice for text and display settings, while its clean, workhorse sans GT America (2016) has made its way onto everything from indie magazines to sparkling water cans. In early January, though, Grilli’s work found overnight notoriety when the CIA released a millennial-friendly rebrand with Sectra and America at its heart. Long known for leveraging modern design to advance state power, the agency seemed to be banking on punchy typography and stylized graphics to improve its image with a new generation of prospective recruits.</p>
                        <p>Grilli’s designers heard about the rebrand with the rest of us. In a January 5 tweet, the foundry distanced itself from the project, explaining that the CIA purchased the font licenses directly from its online shop. “We had no advance knowledge of this use, and no part in their redesign in any way.”</p>
                        <p>Grilli’s lack of control over the lifecycle of its designs is surprisingly standard. While custom jobs are easy to vet, retail fonts are readily available via foundries’ e-commerce platforms. Of course, like most software products, fonts aren’t really for sale: customers “buying” fonts are only purchasing the licensing rights defined by an end-user license agreement (EULA). Introduced by IBM in 1969 and popularized with the rise of personal computing in the 1980s, licensing agreements remain the primary means for software developers to regulate usage and limit liability. For those who care to read them, EULAs for font software are accessible pre-checkout; placing an order equates to signing on the dotted line. Typical agreements dictate parameters like the number of authorized users and application format—for example, whether the font will be used on desktop, web, or app.</p>
                        <p>Recently, some independent foundries (mostly based in Europe) have been giving their EULAs new reach by limiting the usage of their fonts on ethical grounds. Ethical clauses can range from restrictions on use in political campaigns to bans on use in hate speech, and foundries are learning from each other how to develop the right language. While these clauses are open to interpretation and can prove difficult to enforce, designers are hoping tighter restrictions will let them preserve some control even as their work changes hands.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">“An Exhibition of Unrealized Designs Documents the Year That Could Have Been: Dorothee Dähler and Yeliz Secerli’s project Parallel-Parallel exhibits work disrupted during a year of pandemic”</p>
                        <p>“We had the first lockdown on the 13th of March, and I think I sent both posters to print on the 11th,” Zurich-based independent designer Dorothee Dähler says, recalling last spring’s shutdown. Hoping to save her designs for Lucerne’s Museum of History and for an exhibition space in the neighboring village of Emmen, Dähler created stickers listing later opening dates, and her revised posters were installed around town. “We thought it was going to be two weeks,” she remembers with disbelief. A week and a half later, New York City also went dark, leaving the Jewish Museum’s design director Yeliz Secerli with her own stack of exhibition posters hot off the press. As lockdown projections came and went and the pandemic raged on, Dähler and Secerli—friends from their days as graduate students at Werkplaats Typografie—got to talking…what other work was going unseen?</p>
                        <p>Conversations with friends, colleagues, and former teachers quickly unearthed more designs: posters for a culinary pop-up in Paris, a DJ set at Strelka Bar in Moscow, an improvisational jazz festival in Berlin, an experimental type workshop in Cairo. Some had been printed and some, as Dähler puts it, got “stuck in [designers’] computers.” On April 25, 2020, Dähler and Secerli announced the launch of Parallel-Parallel, an online gallery for these works, which now felt like artifacts of a parallel universe—a world of theater festivals, cinema screenings, and what-does-six-feet-apart-mean underground music shows. Wanting to expand beyond their own networks, the duo opened the door for graphic designers to submit commissioned or self-initiated works that “a) have been postponed indefinitely, b) will never be realized or published, c) were published for an event that will never take place because of this damn virus.”</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Manipulated four-color separation reproducing the 1972 photomontage <i>Cubo di Foresta sul Golden Gate</i> by the Italian architecture collective Superstudio. Known for its radical explorations of impossible and imagined elements of the built environment, Superstudio envisioned a cubic forest intersecting the iconic Golden Gate.</p>

                        <p>“Superstudio: Projects & Thoughts” originally published in Domus 479, October 1969</p>

                        <i><p>…The end of architecture is neither to be found in “architecture on architecture” nor in the possible evasions of meta-projects or spiritual retreats. The end of architecture is only a dawn, which we know to be possible by now, with an enormous luminous mushroom.</p>

                        <p>Its hibernation in the towers of intellectual pride (the Greek hubris) is not an operative alternative; standing above the fray means accepting the existence of the fray without doing anything to change it.</p>

                        <p>“Architecture on leave” recalls faith in better days in which to work and above all faith in an unchanging “career” of sprints and advances towards power (or retirement)…</p>

                        <p>The lucid description of a field of multi-directional and sometimes regressive experience leads to ambiguous and unstable results, but ambiguity remains one of the few fixed points in contemporary culture. The tension required to maintain a work open and “in progress” can be born only from ambiguity, the non-solution, the plurality of possible readings…</p>

                        <p>Cultural conditions change incessantly: contribution to this change comes about only by conferring the highest degree of objectivity and clarity on every act. The important thing, as usual, is to save one’s soul, which now means feeling in balance due to the clarity of our actions…</p>

                        <p>A story like “Pilgrim’s Progress” for the salvation of a young architect’s soul.</p>

                        <p>First there was agnostic architecture without masters. Frightened by academia, genius, intelligence… A school outside history, based on empiricism and probabilism. A school based on successive deductions where truth was always a fragment seen through the celestial lens of misunderstood originality… A school where they spoke of many things but never of architecture, as if architecture, history, insights and masters were all legacies of the Twentieth Century-Fascism, Cold Rationalism, Masters-Academies and other similar pseudo-equalities. A school of erroneous equations… In principium… architecture of monuments was the only way to create order, to lay a foundation. The only way to operate was to accept all conscious and unconscious components and consider architecture as a problem with infinite unknowns, assuming a number of them as constants… Constants were assumed to be axes of symmetry, the golden section, elementary forms, archetypes of experience. Through Kahn’s lesson, “order” became the method for recovering history in the action of making architecture. Generating ideas, Neoplatonism were safe ground, a basis for every action.</p>

                        <p>Then there was the architecture of images which proposed the use of news and current events through the mechanism of the invention. The architecture of images was charged with figurative content that could thus induce behaviors.</p>

                        <p>Then came technomorphic architecture proposed not only as technical architecture and not only as architecture of the image of technique but as architecture that was able to consciously use technique and its image.</p></i>
