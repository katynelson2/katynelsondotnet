                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy:   An authoritative guide to one of the world's most important collections of African-American art, with works by artists from Romare Bearden to Kehinde Wiley.  </p>
                        <p>The artists featured in <i>Black Refractions</i>, including Kerry James Marshall, Faith Ringgold, Nari Ward, Norman Lewis, Wangechi Mutu, and Lorna Simpson, are drawn from the renowned collection of the Studio Museum in Harlem. Through exhibitions, public programs, artist residencies, and bold acquisitions, this pioneering institution has served as a nexus for artists of African descent locally, nationally, and internationally since its founding in 1968. Rather than aim to construct a single history of “black art,”  <i>Black Refractions</i> emphasizes a plurality of narratives and approaches, traced through 125 works in all media from the 1930s to the present.  </p>
                        <p>An essay by Connie Choi and entries by Eliza A. Butler, Akili Tommasino, Taylor Aldridge, Larry Ossei Mensah, Daniela Fifi , and other luminaries contextualize the works and provide detailed commentary. A dialogue between Thelma Golden, Connie Choi, and Kellie Jones draws out themes and challenges in collecting and exhibiting modern and contemporary art by artists of African descent. More than a document of a particular institution's trailblazing path, or catalytic role in the development of American appreciation for art of the African diaspora, this volume is a compendium of a vital art tradition.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: Throughout his six-decade career, Tony Conrad (1940–2016) forged a unique path through numerous artistic movements and a vast range of cultural forms—from Fluxus to rock music, from structural film to public access television. Published on the occasion of the first large-scale museum survey devoted to works Conrad presented in museum and gallery settings, this richly illustrated catalogue offers an in-depth introduction to Conrad's life and career.</p>

                        <p>Including new texts and Conrad's own writings about selected works dating from 1966 to 2016, <i>Introducing Tony Conrad</i> surveys the artist's work in painting, sculpture, film, video, performance and installation. It includes the artist's early structural films; projects in which he treated film as a sculptural and performative material; his series of Invented Acoustical Tools, presented as sculptures themselves; his ambitious films about power relations, set in the military and in prison; and his final sculptures and installations, which evoke and critique what he perceived as an emerging culture of surveillance, control and containment. The list of contributors testifies to Conrad's wide and lasting influence; this volume includes texts by Constance DeJong, Diedrich Diederichsen, Anthony Elms, Branden W. Joseph, Tony Oursler and Christopher Williams, among many others.

Published in conjunction with an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art that will feature a combination of videos, photographs, sculptural elements, ephemera and live actions, member: Pope.L, 1978–2001 presents a detailed study of 13 early works that helped define Pope.L’s career. Essays by curators, artists, filmmakers and art historians, plus an interview and artistic interventions by the artist, establish key details for each work and articulate how the artist continues to think about the legacy of these ephemeral projects unfolding in time.</p>
                        <p>Among the works included are performances rooted in experimental theater, such as <i>Egg Eating Contest</i> (1990), <i>Aunt Jenny Chronicles</i> (1991) and <i>Eracism</i> (2000), as well as street interventions such as <i>Thunderbird Immolation a.k.a. Meditation Square Piece</i> (1978), <i>ATM Piece</i> (1997) and <i>The Great White Way: 22 miles, 9 years, 1 street</i> (2001–09), among others. Together these works highlight the role of that performance has played within a seditious, emphatically interdisciplinary career that has established Pope.L as an influential force in contemporary art.

The artwork was inaugurated in July 2016 after 17 years of planning. Irwin’s building-cum-artwork is a career-defining summation of his pioneering art and fulfills a longstanding intention of Chinati founder Donald Judd to include a work by Irwin alongside the renowned collection of permanent installations in Marfa, Texas.</p>

                        <p><i>Robert Irwin: untitled (dawn to dusk)</i> presents and contextualizes Irwin’s artwork through a photographic record of the installation over the course of one year, in addition to critical essays, drawings, plans and illustrations. The publication provides a comprehensive history of the project, describing Irwin’s friendship with Judd and Judd’s support of his work, Chinati’s invitation to the artist in 1999 and the evolution of Irwin’s concept as he visited the site and developed the design for the project.</p>

                        <p>Photography by Alex Marks documents the Irwin project and the effect that the changing seasons and times of day have on the experience of the work.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: One of the most emulated and significant figures in modern art, Andy Warhol (1928–1987) rose to fame in the 1960s with his iconic Pop pieces. Warhol expanded the boundaries by which art is defined and created groundbreaking work in a diverse array of media that includes paintings, sculptures, prints, photographs, films, and installations.</p>
                        <p>This ambitious book is the first to examine Warhol’s work in its entirety. It builds on a wealth of new research and materials that have come to light in recent decades and offers a rare and much-needed comprehensive look at the full scope of Warhol’s production—from his commercial illustrations of the 1950s through his monumental paintings of the 1980s. Donna De Salvo explores how Warhol’s work engages with notions of public and private, the redefinition of media, and the role of abstraction, while a series of incisive and eye-opening essays by eminent scholars and contemporary artists touch on a broad range of topics, such as Warhol’s response to the AIDS epidemic, his international influence, and how his work relates to constructs of self-image seen in social media today.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: Bruce Nauman is widely acknowledged as a central figure in contemporary art, and the stringent questioning of values—both aesthetic and moral—that has long sustained his project remains urgent today. For more than fifty years, Nauman has explored how mutable experiences of time, space, sound, movement, and language provide an insecure foundation for our understanding of our place in the world. This richly illustrated catalogue, which includes rare and previously unpublished images, offers a comprehensive view of the artist’s work in all media—including drawings; early fiberglass sculptures; sound environments; architecturally scaled, participatory constructions; rhythmically blinking neons; and a recent 3-D video that harks back to one of Nauman’s earliest performances. A wide range of authors—artists, curators, and historians of art, architecture, and film—focus on topics that have been largely neglected, such as the architectural structures that posit real or imaginary spaces as models for ethical inquiry and mechanisms of control. Curator Kathy Halbreich’s introductory essay explores Nauman’s many acts of disappearance, withdrawal, and deflection as revelatory of his central formal and intellectual concerns. Eighteen further contributions tease out the various themes that run through this protean and elusive artist’s work.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: Günther Förg (1952–2013) was a German painter, sculptor, and photographer with an irreverent approach to abstraction. Förg’s project tackled the latent instability between image and reality. His painterly surfaces may appear exquisitely sensitive, his installations elegantly precise, but these are mastered and executed with a cold detachment. His deft manipulations of the languages of abstraction obscured a darker message. This publication, the most comprehensive to date, offers an important new understanding of this extraordinary and complex artist. Three years in the making, it reinterprets Förg’s oeuvre to reveal an artistic project that raises important questions about the traditional role of an object as a conveyor of fixed meaning. The book’s subtitle—“A Fragile Beauty”—is an indication of how Förg successfully manipulated what is behind and beyond an object’s appearance.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: The New Museum will present the first American survey exhibition of the work of British artist, film director, and writer John Akomfrah (b. 1957, Accra, Ghana). Since the early 1980s, Akomfrah’s moving image works have offered some of the most rigorous and expansive reflections on the culture of the black diaspora, both in the UK and around the world. Akomfrah’s work initially came to prominence in the early 1980s as part of Black Audio Film Collective, a group of seven artists founded in 1982 in response to the 1981 Brixton riots. The collective produced a number of films notable for their mix of archival and found footage, interviews and realist depictions of contemporary England, and layered sound collages. In works like Handsworth Songs (1986), Akomfrah and Black Audio outlined the political and economic forces leading to social unrest throughout England. Akomfrah and Black Audio’s works were remarkable for their trenchant political inquiries and consistently experimental approach. They were also pioneering in their injection of narratives of black British history and culture into popular media through documentaries made for British television.  
                        </p>
                        <p>Throughout the 1990s, Akomfrah’s subject matter expanded beyond the social fractures of contemporary British society to focus on a wider historical context, from the persistent legacy of colonialism to the roots of the contemporary in classical literature. Moving into the early 2000s, Akomfrah also produced a series of atmospheric works addressing personal and historical memory. In the past several years, his multichannel video works have evolved into ambitious, large-scale installations shown in museums around the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>  Although Akomfrah’s work has had a direct and profound influence on subsequent generations of British artists working across media, the importance of his work has yet to be fully felt in America. The centerpiece of the exhibition at the New Museum will be Akomfrah’s celebrated three-screen video installation <i>Vertigo Sea</i> (2015). The work, which first premiered at the 2015 Venice Biennale and will have its first New York presentation at the New Museum, focuses on the ocean as an environmental, cultural, and historical force, connecting literature and poetry, the history of slavery, and contemporary issues of migration and climate change. The exhibition will also include <i>The Unfinished Conversation</i> (2012), Akomfrah’s complex reflection on the life and ideas of cultural theorist Stuart Hall; <i>Expeditions – Signs of Empire</i> (1983), the first work produced by Black Audio Film Collective; and a new version of Akomfrah’s <i>Transfigured Night</i> (2013/2018), a two-channel work looking at the relationship between the US and post-colonial African history.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">In the early 1960s, an assembly of choreographers, visual artists, composers, and filmmakers made use of a church in New York’s Greenwich Village to present performances that redefined the kinds of movement that could be understood as dance—performances that <i>Village Voice</i> critic Jill Johnston would declare the most exciting in a generation. The group was Judson Dance Theater, its name borrowed from Judson Memorial Church, the socially engaged Protestant congregation that hosted the dancers’ open workshops. The Judson artists emphasized new compositional methods meant to strip dance of its theatrical conventions and foregrounded “ordinary” movements—gestures more likely to be seen on the street or at home. Although Judson Dance Theater would last only a few years, the artists affiliated with it, including Trisha Brown, Lucinda Childs, Philip Corner, Bill Dixon, Judith Dunn, Ruth Emerson, David Gordon, Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Fred Herko, Robert Morris, Steve Paxton, Rudy Perez, Yvonne Rainer, Robert Rauschenberg, Carolee Schneemann, and Elaine Summers, would challenge choreographic conventions and profoundly shape art making across various fields for decades to come.  </p>
                        <p><i>Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done</i> includes newly commissioned essays that highlight the history of Judson Dance Theater and its legacy in our own time. Published in conjunction with an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, this lushly illustrated volume charts the development of Judson through photographs, film stills, choreographic scores, architectural drawings, and other archival materials, as it celebrates the group’s multidisciplinary and collaborative ethos and its reverberant achievements.

From her early wooden Personages to her large hanging sculptures, from suites of drawings and prints to textile works and her immersive Cells, <i>To Unravel a Torment</i> surveys Bourgeois’s career through selected examples from her enormous body of work. Bourgeois was also a prolific writer, matching her sculptural language with reams of psychoanalytic musings on repression, symbolism, and material. <i>To Unravel a Torment</i> also brings together never-before-published diary entries by the artist, annotated by Bourgeois scholar Philip Larratt-Smith, a contribution by art historian Briony Fer, and extensive installation photography.

This is the most thorough survey of the provocative artist, sculptor, and photographer, Sarah Lucas, one of the most important living British artists. Sarah Lucas, having emerged in the UK in the late 1980s alongside artists including Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst, gained notoriety for her bawdy and irreverent sculptures. Often using found objects, Lucas provokes viewers with works that challenge our notions of gender, sexuality, and identity. Featuring eight essays and an interview with the artist, this volume reveals the breadth and complexity of Lucas's work in sculpture, photography, and installation over the past three decades.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: In its continued emphasis on an art of ideas—inherited from the legacies of conceptual and post-conceptual art—contemporary art often enlists objects to perform as evidence within constellations of research and inquiry. Whether they are borrowed from everyday life or sculpted into new forms, art objects are tasked with conjuring the descriptions that accompany them. What challenges does such mediation pose to the inherent muteness of objects? How do artists choose to speak on behalf of reticent artifacts and the otherwise inert by-products of material culture and the natural world? In what ways do museums and other institutions participate in these arrangements?  </p>
                        <p><i>Stories of Almost Everyone</i> is organized around the premise that contemporary art objects possess narrative histories and inner lives that the conventions of display can only, at best, approximate. This exhibition and publication address the means by which a broad range of contemporary artworks and artifacts traffic in meaning and mythology in equal measure. These varied approaches are as emboldened by a faith in objects to communicate their value as they are skeptical of the conditions of museological mediation and art’s promise to convey meaning.  </p>

                        <p>From aerial landscapes to the Alaskan wilderness, American cities to natural history museums, there are few subjects that Zoe Leonard has not tackled in her 30-year career. Working primarily in photography and sculpture, Leonard consistently confronts the realities of change, love, and loss. This book brings audiences up to date on Leonard's impressive body of work and accompanies a long-awaited retrospective exhibition. It features images and examinations from every one of Leonard's major series, including her early aerial and museum photographs, her landmark works⁠—Strange Fruit and Analogue⁠—and her most recent works, "In the Wake." Essays in the book range from the critical to the personal, including explorations of sexual politics, immigration, and family. Breathtaking in scope and bringing together every facet of Leonard's oeuvre, this volume celebrates Leonard's unflinching eye and her intimate art.

                        <p>So begins Stan Brakhage’s classic <i>Metaphors on Vision</i>. First published in 1963 as a special issue of Film Culture, it stands as the major theoretical statement by one of avant-garde cinema’s most influential figures, a treatise on mythopoeia and the nature of visual experience written in a style as idiosyncratic as his art. By turns lyrical, technical, and philosophical, this is a collection to be shelved alongside the commentaries of Robert Bresson and Maya Deren, Sergei Eisenstein and Nagisa Oshima. Yet despite its historical importance and undeniable influence, the complete <i>Metaphors</i> has remained out of print in the US for over forty years.  </p>
                        <p>Now, Anthology Film Archives and Light Industry are proud to present the republication of Metaphors on Vision in a new, definitive edition, featuring a full facsimile of the publication’s original George Maciunas design as well as a corrected version of the text, overseen by P. Adams Sitney. These materials are complemented by Sitney’s introduction to the 1998 French translation of Metaphors on Vision, copious annotations, and an apparatus that meticulously tracks variations in the text across its many iterations.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Sales copy: This catalogue, accompanying the New Museum exhibition “Trigger: Gender as a Tool and a Weapon,” features an intergenerational group of more than forty artists working across film, video, performance, painting, sculpture, photography, and craft to explore gender beyond the binary and usher in more inclusive expressions of identity. The New Museum has been committed to urgent ideas since its inception, devoting many exhibitions and programs throughout its history to issues of representation with regard to gender and sexuality, among them “Extended Sensibilities” (1982), “Difference” (1984–85), “HOMO VIDEO” (1986–87), and “Bad Girls” (1994). Following in this tradition, “Trigger” extends these conversations around identity, while considering how even a fluid conception of gender is marked by ongoing negotiations of power and cannot be understood outside its complex intersections with race, class, sexuality, and disability.  </p>
                        <p>Many of the artists in the exhibition embrace explicit pleasure and visual lushness as political strategies. Some deliberately reject or complicate overt representation, turning to poetic language, docufiction, and abstraction to affirm ambiguities and reflect shifting modes of embodiment. Representing no single point of view, and in some cases presenting productively contradictory positions, “Trigger” assembles artists for their singular efforts in considering gender’s capacity to represent a more general refusal of stable categorization—a refusal at the heart of today’s most compelling artistic practices.  </p>
                        <p>Edited by Johanna Burton and Natalie Bell, the catalogue includes essays by Rizvana Bradley, Johanna Burton, and Jeannine Tang, as well as a conversation between Julia Bryan-Wilson and Mel Y. Chen. Three edited roundtable conversations with the exhibition’s advisory group (Lia Gangitano, Ariel Goldberg, Jack Halberstam, Fred Moten, and Eric A. Stanley) as well as monographic entries on the artists in the show provide further insight into the broader questions, ideas, and cultural shifts informing the exhibition and its artists. In addition to over two hundred pages of color reproductions, the catalogue’s institutional archival portfolio, organized by Kate Wiener, traces past Museum exhibitions that have centered on intersections of gender, sexuality, and representation, and the artists’ genealogies section, organized by Sara O’Keeffe, reveals artists’ own formative affinities and artistic filiations within art and culture.

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Arcobaleno is a monolinear display sans. Taking as its point of departure Archizoom Associati’s “Grande A” of <i>Letti di sogno</i> (Dream Beds, 1967) and the imagined <i>Ponte Arcobaleno</i> (Rainbow Bridge, 1968), Arcobaleno’s optically symmetrical curves and playful, quirky details seek to capture the group’s at once critical and joyful formal play.</p>

                        <p>FRAC Centre-Val de Loire:<br>
                            “In 1967, using <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, Archizoom imagined the <i>Letti di sogno</i>, and thereby introduced the use of design in a critical way in the civilization of mass consumption. If the form of the bedrooms tends towards a symbolic and sacred simplification, the decoration of these “dream beds” is made voluntarily over the top and kitsch, through the use of imitation marble made from laminated plastic, the superposition of pop symbols and signs, as well as leopard skins and stuffed animals. In their anti-design approach, these micro-architectures denounce the ever increasing proliferation of objects. They are emblematic of an 'aggressive, closed objectuality of opposition, which imposes itself on the surrounding environment by the power of its language' (Andrea Branzi). Here, Archizoom is interested in the image as a whole and, through the image, in the possibility of expressing a judgment on the civilization of the image.”

The selected works are drawn from different periods and context, but all remain alarmingly relevant in the Trump era. By creating vector graphics of works with previously limited digital documentation, Signsignsigns aims to make these designs usable once more for protests, mailing campaigns, or other non-commercial uses. Each work is accompanied by an explanatory text, and a master list of resources offers guidance for those interested in archives of political design.

Known for its radical explorations of impossible and imagined elements of the built environment, Superstudio envisioned a cubic forest intersecting the iconic Golden Gate.</p>

                        <p>“Superstudio: Projects & Thoughts”  originally published in Domus 479, October 1969 </p>

                        <p><i>…The end of architecture is neither to be found in "architecture on architecture” nor in the possible evasions of meta-projects or spiritual retreats. The end of architecture is only a dawn, which we know to be possible by now, with an enormous luminous mushroom.  </p>

                        <p>Its hibernation in the towers of intellectual pride (the Greek hubris) is not an operative alternative; standing above the fray means accepting the existence of the fray without doing anything to change it.  </p>

                        <p>“Architecture on leave” recalls faith in better days in which to work and above all faith in an unchanging “career” of sprints and advances towards power (or retirement)…  </p>

                        <p>The lucid description of a field of multi-directional and sometimes regressive experience leads to ambiguous and unstable results, but ambiguity remains one of the few fixed points in contemporary culture. The tension required to maintain a work open and “in progress” can be born only from ambiguity, the non-solution, the plurality of possible readings…  </p>

                        <p>Cultural conditions change incessantly: contribution to this change comes about only by conferring the highest degree of objectivity and clarity on every act. The important thing, as usual, is to save one’s soul, which now means feeling in balance due to the clarity of our actions…  </p>

                        <p>A story like “Pilgrim’s Progress” for the salvation of a young architect’s soul.  </p>

                        <p>First there was agnostic architecture without masters. Frightened by academia, genius, intelligence… A school outside history, based on empiricism and probabilism. A school based on successive deductions where truth was always a fragment seen through the celestial lens of misunderstood originality… A school where they spoke of many things but never of architecture, as if architecture, history, insights and masters were all legacies of the Twentieth Century-Fascism, Cold Rationalism, Masters-Academies and other similar pseudo-equalities. A school of erroneous equations… In principium… architecture of monuments was the only way to create order, to lay a foundation. The only way to operate was to accept all conscious and unconscious components and consider architecture as a problem with infinite unknowns, assuming a number of them as constants… Constants were assumed to be axes of symmetry, the golden section, elementary forms, archetypes of experience. Through Kahn’s lesson, “order” became the method for recovering history in the action of making architecture. Generating ideas, Neoplatonism were safe ground, a basis for every action.  </p>

                        <p>Then there was the architecture of images which proposed the use of news and current events through the mechanism of the invention. The architecture of images was charged with figurative content that could thus induce behaviors.  </p>

                        <p>Then came technomorphic architecture proposed not only as technical architecture and not only as architecture of the image of technique but as architecture that was able to consciously use technique and its image.  </p>

                        <p>The architecture of monuments – architecture as the magical image of man – was an exorcism against the architecture of detail and the picturesque. The architecture of History. The architecture of images – the architecture of chronicles and the manifesto – was an exorcism against history as crystallization of experience. Architecture was an object of use.  </p>

                        <p>Technomorphic architecture moved attention to hypothesis and the future exorcising doubts and fears introduced by the machine in the work of the sorcerers’ apprentices. Architecture was a machine that functioned symbolically…  </p>

                        <p>And so the past-present-future circle was closed like a magic pentacle. Every demonstration “per absurdum” had been made. And reason had found a field cleared of misunderstandings and a series of “materials” upon which to act. At a time when architecture undermines itself by delegating its decision-making acts and working methods to other disciplines, it becomes important to reaffirm its dignity through the only technique possible, that of “acting according to reason.”  </i></p>
